###

<p align="left">
  <b>Obstacle Avoidance:</b> Equipped with an ultrasonic sensor, the robot car can detect obstacles in its path. This allows it to navigate safely, avoiding   
   collisions   
  and ensuring smooth operation in various environments.

  <b>Line Following:</b> Utilizing an infrared (IR) sensor, the robot car can autonomously follow a designated path marked by a line. This feature is perfect for 
  applications such as automated delivery or educational demonstrations.
  
  <b>Remote Driving:</b> Users can take full control of the car through a mobile phone interface. This feature provides the flexibility to maneuver the robot car 
  in real-time, making it an engaging experience for users of all ages.
